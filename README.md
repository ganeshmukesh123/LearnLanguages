# LearnLanguages
Learn new and different languages.

<br>

Hey there, 

This repo contains the code for learning many languages. I'll be adding more languages.

### Target Audience

1. People who want to learn languages in a short period of time.
2. People who want the sample code for remembering the syntax of the languages.
3. People who just want to brush up or update their knowledge of a particular language.
4. People who want to just clear the basics of a language before an interview.

### Added Languages

1. ES6 (EcmaScript 2015)

### Upcoming Languages

1. PHP (Will be added soon)
2. C#
3. Python

### Learning/Reading Strategy

Just go through the code file from the starting. The file is prepared in a such that it starts from basics first and then covers the advanced topics.
Uncomment the 'console.log' lines to read the message as you go through the code. Finally, play around the code and get your hands dirty.
